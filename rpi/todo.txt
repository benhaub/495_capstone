Need to test fans
Send two characters per rule
Have kelsey acknowledge only after both chars send correctly
Can I send two characters at the same time or do the need to be sent one
after the other
Buffer cmds in case the first one fails
Change zone1_mailbox to zone1_mailbox[2] and send each char with two
write() calls.
What are the door commands for each door?
